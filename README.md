</strong># Lead_Generator</strong>

<strong>API Key:</strong> -Enter your own Google API Key- (You will need to get your Google API key on your own.
          eventually, I amy provide a guide on how to do that. But for now, Google it.

<strong>Location:</strong> -Location you want to search- (pretty straight forward) [city] or [city & state] or [zip code]

<strong>Radius:</strong> - radius around location in meters - 5km = 5000,  25km = 25000, 5 miles = Google it

<strong>Query:</strong> - What you want to search for - "Knitting", "Dentists", "dog food taste testers"

<strong>Number of Results:</strong> - For now only enter "20" - eventually I will add in the code to provide multiples of 20 results or Pages. 

<strong>Results:</strong> - I am quite sure that you can tell what this is. If not, perhaps you should find a new line of work.

<strong>[Search]</strong> button - does just that, starts the search with the provided information.

<strong>[Open Results File]</strong> - "Should" open the latest search results file. for now, this is just a text document. eventually I will format it and present it in a better manner.

<strong>[Quit]</strong> - Again, does just what it says.

_____List of features to add (someday):_____
<br>
[] Website of each search result, if applicable<br>
[] Save your API key between sessions.<br>
[] Increase number of results. Either multiples of 20 or specific amounts. Each google maps "page" has 20 businesses.<br>
[] Results file in a easier to use format. perhaps CSV, or XLSX, or HTML. Or provide multiple export options.<br>
[] Allow user to set which specifc result parameters to return. Name, Address, Phone Number, Website, Hours, etc.... Only show what each user wants to see.<br>
[] Allow users to specify where to save search results. Or allow user to specify to even save results or not.<br>
[] Allow user to choose to see "RAW" search data. (just an option to allow folks to see it all, revealed)<br>
